        <p align="center">PHP, which stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a widely-used server-side scripting language designed for web development. Originally created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf, PHP has evolved into a powerful and versatile programming language. It is embedded within HTML code and executed on the server, generating dynamic web pages.</p>
    <p>Key features of PHP include:</p>

           <dt> <b>Open Source</b></dt>
           <dd>PHP is open-source software, which means it is freely available for use, modification, and distribution.</dd>
        <dt><b>Server-Side Scripting</b></dt>
        <dd>PHP is primarily used for server-side scripting, allowing developers to execute code on the server before sending the processed HTML to the client's browser. This enables the creation of dynamic and interactive web pages.</dd>
