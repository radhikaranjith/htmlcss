        <p>Front-end:The front-end, also known as the client-side, is what the user interacts with directly. It includes the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) components of a website or web application.
            Technologies commonly used for front-end development include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js are often employed to enhance the development process and create dynamic, interactive user interfaces.
            <br><br>Back-end:The back-end, or server-side, is responsible for managing and processing data, business logic, and server-side operations. It works behind the scenes and is not directly accessed or seen by the end user.
            Back-end development involves server-side scripting, databases, and server management. Common programming languages for back-end development include Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, and Node.js. Frameworks like Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Spring (Java), Laravel (PHP), and Express.js (Node.js) are often used to streamline back-end development.</p>
