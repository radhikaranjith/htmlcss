        <h1>Plotter</h1>
    <p>A plotter is a computer output device that draws vector graphics. It uses pens or other writing instruments to create precise, large-scale images on paper or other surfaces. 

    Plotters are commonly used in engineering, design, and architectural applications for producing detailed and accurate technical drawings and diagrams.
