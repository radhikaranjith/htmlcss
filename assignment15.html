    <h1 align="center">PHP</h1>
    <blockquote align="center"><p>PHP, which stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a widely-used server-side scripting language designed for web development. Originally created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf, PHP has evolved into a powerful and versatile programming language. It is embedded within HTML code and executed on the server, generating dynamic web pages.

        Key features of PHP include:
        
        Open Source: PHP is open-source software, which means it is freely available for use, modification, and distribution.
        
        Server-Side Scripting: PHP is primarily used for server-side scripting, allowing developers to execute code on the server before sending the processed HTML to the client's browser. This enables the creation of dynamic and interactive web pages.
        
        Cross-Platform Compatibility: PHP is compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it a flexible choice for web development.</p></blockquote>
