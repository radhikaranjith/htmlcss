        <h1>Scanner</h1>
            <p>A scanner is a device that captures images or documents and converts them into digital format. It uses sensors or cameras to read and reproduce content. 
        
            Scanners come in various types, including flatbed, sheet-fed, and handheld, providing versatile solutions for tasks like document digitization, image archiving, and graphic reproduction.
